# Flappy Fitness

Flappy Fitness is an interactive fitness game that uses a camera to track exercises and provide real-time feedback. The game features three main exercises: squats, jumping jacks, and toe touches. Flappy Fitness uses a Pose Estimation algorithm in MediaPipe to detect the motion of specific body landmarks to determine whether a player is correctly performing the required exercise, and if it is then sending communicating this information through SocketIO to the PyGame program controlling the movements of the bird in a one-way flow of data.

## Files and Their Purposes

- `main.py`: Initializes the game, connects to the server, and runs the main game loop.
- `exercises.py`: Handles exercise detection using computer vision and connects to the server to send exercise data.
- `server.py`: Handles server-side operations, including connecting clients and receiving exercise data.
- `run_it_all.py`: Runs the main, exercise, and server files concurrently.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure you have all the required dependencies installed. You can install them using pip.
    ```bash
    pip install pygame socketio opencv-python mediapipe eventlet
    ```

2. **Run the Application**: Execute the `run_it_all.py` script to start the game, exercise detection, and server concurrently.
    ```bash
    python run_it_all.py
    ```

1. **Starting the Game**:
    - When you start the game, it will connect to the server and wait for the player to begin.
    - The game will randomly select one of the three exercises: squats, jumping jacks, or toe touches.

2. **Exercise Guidelines**:
    - **Squats**: Ensure your arms go below your knees and your legs form a 90-degree angle.
    - **Jumping Jacks**: Your arms should touch at the top and then retreat back while jumping.
    - **Toe Touches**: Your hands should completely touch your toes.

3. **Camera Setup**:
    - Ensure your entire body is visible in the camera frame at all times for accurate detection.
    - Position yourself at a distance where your full body fits within the camera view.

4. **In-Game Feedback**:
    - The game will provide real-time feedback on your exercise form and count your repetitions.
    - Make sure to follow the visual feedback to maintain proper form.
